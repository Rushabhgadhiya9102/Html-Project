      Ukraine’s army chief, Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskii, said on Sunday
      that Russian forces aimed to capture the city of Chasiv Yar by May 9,
      setting the stage for an important battle for control of high ground in
      the east where Russia is focusing its assaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fall of Chasiv Yar, west of the shattered city of Bakhmut, by the date
      Moscow marks the Soviet victory in World War II would indicate growing
      Russian battlefield momentum as Kyiv faces a slowdown in Western military
      aid.

      Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think
      tank in Philadelphia, said on X that Chasiv Yar would likely prove an
      important battle. “Chasiv Yar is located on defensible high ground. If
      Russia takes the [town], they could potentially increase the rate of
      advance deeper into Donetsk [region] as part of an expected summer
      offensive,” he said.

      Separately, fragments from a downed Russian missile fell on a settlement
      outside the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Sunday, injuring 12
      people, the regional governor Serhiy Lysak said.

      Lysak also said Russian forces used artillery in 11 attacks on the town of
      Nikopol, a frequent target opposite the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia Nuclear
      Power Plant. He said four people had been injured.

      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainians in his nightly
      address on Sunday: “The situation at the front during such a hot war is
      always difficult. But these days – and especially on the Donetsk front –
      it’s getting harder.”
